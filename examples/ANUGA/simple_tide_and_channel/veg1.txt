# Vegetation factsheet 
# generic salt marsh without mud
# GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS (first row)
# 1.1. maximum age
# 1.2. amount of ets seed dispersal
# 1.3. Colonisation method (1 = on bare substrate between max and min water levels, 2 = on bare substrate with mud content
# 1.4. Growth method (2 = linear seasonal growth within year; e.g. saltmarsh)
# 1.5. vegetation formula (is fixed with Baptiste 2007: 154, for different formula other parameters are required)
# 1.6. number of life stages 
# 1.7. initial root length in m
# 1.8. initial shoot length in m
# 1.9. initial stem diameter in m
# 1.10. Vegetation type (1 = saltmarsh)
# 1.11. placeholders in case of growth strategy 1 (excluded here)
# 1.14 Ecological timestep start growth shoot (in case of growth method 2)
# 1.15 Ecological timestep end growth shoot (in case of growth method 2) 
# 1.16 Ecological timestep  step start winter period
# 
# 2.1 Ecological timestep at which colonisation starts 
# 2.2 Ecological timestep of last colonisation (NT: this was 3, changed to 2 for simplicity for now)
#
#
# LIFE STAGE CHARACTERISTICS (from third row onwards, depending on how many life-stages are given in general characteristics)
# 3.1. maximum plant height growth [m]
# 3.2. max stem diameter at ets "end growth shoot"
# 3.3. max root length [m] at ets "end growth root"
# 3.4. maximum number of years in life-stage
# 3.5. number of stems per m2 
# 3.6. initial colonization fraction (0-1)
# 3.7. drag coefficient
# 3.8. mud percentage for colonization
# 3.9. dry fraction below which there is no mortality
# 3.10. dry fraction above which there total mortality
# 3.11. flood fraction below which there is no mortality
# 3.12. flood fraction above which there total no mortality
# 3.13. flow velocity below which there is no mortality
# 3.14. flow velocity above which there is total mortality
# 3.15  max height during winter time 
# 3.16  Salinity tolerance placeholder (excluded here)
